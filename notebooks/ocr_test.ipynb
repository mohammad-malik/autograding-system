        "2.  **Evaluative/Corrective Language:** Identify phrases containing direct feedback, judgment, or correction. Common indicators include:\n",
        "    *   \"not valid\", \"not in XNF\" (when used as a standalone correction, not part of student's argument), \"sorry :|\", \"do not\", \"wrong\", \"correct\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"partial dependency exists\" (when used as a direct correction to a student's incorrect statement).\n",
        "    *   Phrases like \"How can it be 3NF if it is not even 2NF?\"\n",
        "    *   Phrases like \"no decomposition.\", \"no yes/no\", \"functional dependency this wouldn't be a relation if there was not any functional dependencies.\"\n",
        "    *   Phrases like \"These new table will be created\" (as an instruction/correction).\n",
        "3.  **Numerical/Symbolic Annotations:** Lines consisting solely of a single digit, a circled digit (e.g., '①', '②', '⓪'), or simple symbols like 'X' or '✓' that indicate a mark or score.\n",
        "4.  **Syntactic Disruption:** Remarks often appear to break the flow of the student's answer, either on a new line or as an inserted comment that doesn't logically connect to the surrounding student text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**CRITICAL EXCEPTION:** Be extremely careful not to remove legitimate parts of the student's answer that might *contain* words like \"no\" or \"not\" if they are part of their technical explanation (e.g., \"The relation is **not** in 2NF because **no** partial dependency exists...\"). Distinguish between student's reasoning and teacher's direct feedback. If a phrase like \"no partial dependency exists\" is presented as a student's justification, it should be kept. If it's a short, isolated correction from the teacher, it should be removed. Context is key.\n",
